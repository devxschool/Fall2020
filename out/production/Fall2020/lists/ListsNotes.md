##Lists

- Lists have dynamic size. Size can be dynamically changed at the runtime. (while program is running)
- Lists have many handful methods
- Lists can only store non-primitive data types (Objects), so we can not store primitives like int,double, char
rather we have to use Wrapperclass for each primitive data type.


##Wrapper classes
each primitive data type has a wrapper class which is essensially a workaround for lists to be able to store
data types such as Intgers, double.

int -> Integer
double -> Double
char -> Character
boolean -> Boolean
float -> Float
