###OOP
OOPs primary usage is to create custom(own) data types which can 
represent the entities our company manages. 
in ex: 

a class for a Trader -> information about the trader
a class for an account  -> information about an account.

####Classes
Classes are blueprints for the information. By designing classes
we are dictating, choosing what kind of information needs to be 
provided and further stored about an entity.

ex: class for a Trader. 
As a PO I want to validate Trader's age, ssn, porfolio.

As a Bank Account user, I want to have info about my current balance.
about my last 10 transactions.
about my account and routing numbers.
