###Junit - 

1. Java unit testing -> Junit is an open source java library that helps executing unit tests in automated way. 

###open source -> means free to use

java library -> means some java program(classes and methods) that we can use to achive some tasks. So some company(guys) developed a program that solves a problem so we just reuse their solutions.

right now all we have to do is to learn how to use programs that someone has created. 

###ex of libraries: 
JDK libraries -> Scanner, System, Random, Math, String.

external libraries -> Junit, TestNG, Cucumber, Selenium, JDBC, RestAssured, Jackson, Hamcrest

###.jar -> is the final artifact of a java program.
external libraries are not included into our program, so we have to dowload .jar(java architype) file and import it to our java project. 

some .jar files(libraries) will have a dependency on other .jar files(libraries).

java is super cool in that it you can create programs for users to use. or you can create programs for other developer to use.


###dependency -> dependent on, can not work without some other jar file. 

what is a method?
- is a block of a code which runs only when we call it? 
- we use methods in order to avoid repetition of the same logic in the code. you use the logic everywhere you need it. if there is a change in the logic then you  only need to change it in one place. That gives you great code maintainability.


###Unit test -> is a test of a java method.  this is done by developer of an application. 

Unit test is the first test in the whole hierachy of tests. 
Unit test is a first level of test automation. Devs will need a way to always test their methods. 

Junit helps getting result of method, and craeting report. it helps executing multiple(1000 tests) at once. 


###Steps to Import jar files

1. Download jar file
2. open intelliJ -> File
3. Project Structure
4. Choose Libraries on the left panel
5. Hit + sign
6. Choose java
7. Find .jar file click
8. And Ok.
