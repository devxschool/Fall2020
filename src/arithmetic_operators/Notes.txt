Difference between single | and double ||

when || is used it will not execute the second part of the comparison
if the first one is true.  Since for conditional OR one true is enought to
return true.

What do we get in ROI(Return on investment)
we get faster execution. So we save time.

Difference between && and & ->
&& will return false if the first comparison is false.
So it's not going to check the second part even.

& -> Checks both sides anyways.
